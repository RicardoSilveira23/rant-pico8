# Team Rant's Game

With the theme **Discovery** in mind the game developed for the [Retro Jam](http://portographics.tech/retrojam) using the PICO-8 engine, is centered in the self-discovery of an old man with Alzheimer's, that shortly after his wife and life companion passed found himself in life/death situation.

The death of his wife left him alone and in the dark, afraid and lost he startes leaving notes around the house preparing for the moments when his memory would trick him.

Throughout the game you will find yourself lost in the scenery and the sounds as you realize that the only key to save him from that cold, dark and wintery night will be the recovery of what was taken from him… it’s **memory.

Will you be able to help this poor soul find out who he is and live through another night…

**Find it out in our game**.
